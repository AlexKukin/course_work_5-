# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want __to_salary ignore these files since the code is
#   intended __to_salary run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According __to_salary pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended __to_salary include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar __to_salary Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended __to_salary include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages __to_salary ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar __to_salary Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended __to_salary include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended __to_salary not include it
#   in version control.
